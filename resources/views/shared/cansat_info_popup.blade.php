            Design a Cansat that will consist of a container and a science payload. The science payload shall be
            a delta wing glider that will glide in a circular pattern, once released.<br><br>The Cansat shall be
            launched to an altitude ranging 670 meters to 725 meters above the launch site and deployed near
            apogee (peak altitude). Orientation of deployment is not controlled and is most definitely violent.
            The CanSat container must protect the science payload from damage during the launch and
            deployment.<br><br>Once the CanSat is deployed from the rocket, the CanSat shall descend using a
            parachute at a descent rate of 20 m/s. At 450 meters, the container shall release the science
            payload. The science payload shall glide in a circular pattern with a radius of 250 meters
            collecting sensor data for one minute and remain above 100 meters after being released. Afterwards,
            the glider shall deploy a parachute to cause the glider to stop gliding and drop to the ground at a
            rate of 10 meters/second.<br><br>The science payload shall monitor altitude, air speed and the
            science payload shall be a particulate matter/dust sensor to detect particulates in the air while
            gliding.

            Design a Cansat that shall consist of a container and two autorotating maple seed science payloads.
            The container shall contain electronics to release the autorotating maple seed science payloads and
            relay data from the payload to a ground station.<br><br>The Cansat shall be launched to an altitude
            ranging 670 meters to 725 meters above the launch site and deployed near apogee (peak altitude).
            Orientation of deployment is not controlled and is most definitely violent. The CanSat container
            must protect the science payloads from damage during the launch and deployment.<br><br>Once the
            CanSat is deployed from the rocket, the CanSat shall descend using a parachute at a descent rate of
            15 m/s. At 500 meters, the container shall release one autorotating maple seed science payload. At

            so its descent rate is less than 20 m/s. The science payload shall transmit telemetry once a second
            and include air pressure and air temperature. The science payload shall transmit for five minutes
            after being released and use the team number plus 5 as its net ID.

            Design a Cansat that shall consist of a container and a payload. The payload shall be attached to
            the container by a 10 meter long tether. The Cansat shall be launched to an altitude ranging from
            670 meters to 725 meters above the launch site and deployed near apogee (peak altitude). Orientation
            of deployment is not controlled and is very violent with large shock forces. The Cansat must survive
            the forces incurred at launch and deployment.<br><br>Once the Cansat is deployed from the rocket,
            the Cansat shall descend using a parachute at a rate of 15 m/s. At 400 meters, the Cansat shall
            deploy a larger parachute to reduce the descent rate to 5 m/s. At 300 meters, the Cansat shall
            release a tethered payload to a distance of 10 meters in 20 seconds. During that time, the payload
            shall maintain the orientation of a video camera pointing in the south direction. The video camera
            shall be pointed 45 degrees downward to assure terrain is in the video.><br><br>Bonus: As the
            container is releasing the payload, the container shall contain a video camera and start recording
            to show the descent of the payload. All videos are to be recorded and recovered when the Cansat is
            recovered from the field.
